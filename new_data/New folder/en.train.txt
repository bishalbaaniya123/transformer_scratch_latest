and | W | he asked | the old men
how did | you kill | all kinds of | fowls | you | being blind
old men | never told him
then | the old men | said to him
you can travel on | soon after | again | return
then | you can live with us
then | W | started off
then | he changed | the guide-rope | the way | water | they fetched | the old men

then | one | threw | guide-rope
then | he felt of it | his guide rope

what will | we do to | our grandson
“we can draw him by smoking”
then | they filled up | a pipe
then |  they smoked
they drew him by smoking | W.
then | W. | returned
then | the old men | let it be shut | thought they wished | It closed
the old men | we will kill him | W.
then | spears | each one | they used | punching around for him
after | they shut him in | then | they punched around for him

then | he spoke to them | my grandfathers | don't kill me
then | is that you | W.
it is I | my grandfathers | I returned
again | to cook for you | if you don’t kill me

soon after | W. | he was getting tired | of living with | the old men
then | I wish | you'd tell me | the way you caught | geese | ducks
it is no | trouble | the way they are caught
soon after | to lake | when you go | right there | plenty | you will see | all kinds of | fowls
and | plenty of | very small twine | you shall take
and | all | you will tie | around your belt
then | on one side | of the lake | dive
and | the feet | you will tie them
Every now and then | he stuck his nose out
now and then | he breathed
again | he dove

then | he made a mistake
he wished | “in a hollow | I might fall” | he said to himself
instead | “in a tree | I might fall into” | he said
then | I wonder how | I will get out? | he said to | himself

Le Boullenger's translates: "that could not go [Lat. for example] into a ring". Pinet's French says "the ring could not go into, that could not". However, it is possible that the *idea* is a ring, but the subject of the verb is a finger.)

The same phrase and meaning is noted here two lines below in Pinet's dictionary.)
I commend to him .. I beg him to take care of, to nourish him well--almost (trans. note: the abbreviation appears to signify "quasiment," which means "almost". I can only surmise that Pinet means that the Miami verb nearly means "I beg you to take care of, to nourish him well".The Miami phrase includes the word "my child" in the expected obviative form.)

The term "species" identifies the "accidents," i.e., the size, weight, color, taste, and odor of bread, for example, which remain the same after transubstantiation into the body and blood of Christ.

So perhaps “something scrapes my throat”?? Not sure what role the -ehkaw is playing there.")
