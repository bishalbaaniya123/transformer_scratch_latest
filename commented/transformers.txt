This code defines three different classes, EncoderRNN, DecoderRNN, and AttnDecoderRNN, which are all implementations of RNNs.
The EncoderRNN class takes in an input_size and hidden_size as arguments in its initialization. It has two main components, an embedding layer and a gru layer. The embedding layer is responsible for converting the input into a dense representation, and the gru layer is a type of RNN that processes the embedded input. The forward method of this class takes in an input and a hidden state, and returns an output and a new hidden state. The class also has an init_hidden method that returns a zero tensor with the shape of (1, 1, hidden_size)
The DecoderRNN class is similar to the EncoderRNN class, but it takes in a hidden_size and output_size as arguments in its initialization. In addition to the embedding and gru layers, it also has an out linear layer, and a softmax layer. The forward method of this class takes in an input and a hidden state, and returns an output and a new hidden state. The class also has an init_hidden method that returns a zero tensor with the shape of (1, 1, hidden_size)
The AttnDecoderRNN class is also similar to the DecoderRNN class, but it also takes in a dropout_p and max_length as arguments in its initialization. It also has an additional attn linear layer, an attn_combine linear layer, and a dropout layer. The forward method of this class takes in an input, a hidden state, and encoder_outputs, and returns an output, a new hidden state, and attention weights. The class also has an init_hidden method that returns a zero tensor with the shape of (1, 1, hidden_size).
