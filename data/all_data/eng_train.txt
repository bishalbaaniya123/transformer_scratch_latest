and | sometime | he lived with them
sometime after | I will leave them | he thought | his grandfather
then | he told them| I am getting tired | the way | I am living with you
then | again | I will travel around | so I think | my grandfathers
and | W | he asked | the old men
how did | you kill | all kinds of | fowls | you | being blind
old men | never told him
then | the old men | said to him
you can travel on | soon after | again | return
then | you can live with us
then | W | started off
then | he changed | the guide-rope | the way | water | they fetched | the old men
that way | he strung it | towards | a steep bank
then | W. | left | the old men
soon after | the old men | got hungry
then | let us cook
then | one | water | I will go after
then | he went out | feeling for | his guide rope
then | he started
all at once | he stepped off | the road
then | he fell down | the steep hill
then | he called | his friend
then | he came
what | is the matter with you [happened] | my friend
I fell down | be careful | walk right | you might be | falling down
then | one | threw | guide-rope
then | he felt of it | his guide rope
then | he pulled out | his friend
then | got out on top of the bank
then | our grandson | he changed for us | the guide rope
then | returning | they entered | the wigwam
what will | we do to | our grandson
“we can draw him by smoking”
then | they filled up | a pipe
then |  they smoked
they drew him by smoking | W.
then | W. | returned

then | the old men | let it be shut | thought they wished | It closed
then | the door | it was closing
the old men | we will kill him | W.
then | spears | each one | they used | punching around for him
after | they shut him in | then | they punched around for him
some time after | W. | got tired
then | he spoke to them | my grandfathers | don't kill me
then | is that you | W.
it is I | my grandfathers | I returned
again | to cook for you | if you don’t kill me
then | the old men | was it you | that changed them for us | the guide rope
the way | water | we go after
it is true | I | changed | the guide-rope
then | I forgot it | I was going | change it back | before | I started
I didn't | purposely | do that to you”
then | the old men | again | you can live with us
then | W. | lived with them | enough | length of time
soon after | W. | he was getting tired | of living with | the old men
then | I wish | you'd tell me | the way you caught | geese | ducks
it is no | trouble | the way they are caught
soon after | to lake | when you go | right there | plenty | you will see | all kinds of | fowls
and | plenty of | very small twine | you shall take
and | all | you will tie | around your belt
then | on one side | of the lake | dive
and | the feet | you will tie them
Every now and then | he stuck his nose out
now and then | he breathed
again | he dove
again | he tied | the feet

Le Boullenger's translates: "that could not go [Lat. for example] into a ring". Pinet's French says "the ring could not go into, that could not". However, it is possible that the *idea* is a ring, but the subject of the verb is a finger.)

The same phrase and meaning is noted here two lines below in Pinet's dictionary.)
(I send) for him
I commend to him .. I beg him to take care of, to nourish him well--almost (trans. note: the abbreviation appears to signify "quasiment," which means "almost". I can only surmise that Pinet means that the Miami verb nearly means "I beg you to take care of, to nourish him well".The Miami phrase includes the word "my child" in the expected obviative form.)
